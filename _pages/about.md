This is the GitHub homepage for Christopher Hughes. I am a research scientist currently working at the Cancer Research Centre in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. I have a keen interest in mass spectrometry and nucleic acid sequencing and their applications in the examination of a variety of molecular biology questions. On this page you will find details of manuscripts I have been part of, [step-by-step protocols](https://chrishuges.github.io/protocols/), and projects I am working on. Please contact me through this page if you have any questions related to anything you see here!
